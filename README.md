# -Survey-Analysis-of-Data-Professionals-Power-BI
This project is intended to brush up and practice dashboarding skills in Power BI

I have chosen a simple dataset to begin with 

Understood what the data is about and analyzed it for drawing possible insights from it 

For instance, this dataset has stored values from the survey of data professionals and their ratings about various benefits of their current work environment 

While cleaning & transforming the data in Power query, I have removed unwanted columns, checked for blanks and injected relevant data values in the respective columns, datatype check, content formatting by splitting columns and keeping only the relevant content, changed the meta data of every column for easy readability of the audience, added a calculated column of Average salary from the Salary range column, handled outliers and loaded the data 

Tried various visualizations before getting the final picture 

Concluded it by writing few insights that the visuals conveyed at the end
